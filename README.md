#### Overview

Prototype of a Radar Simulator. This project was made with the objective to simulate the behavior of a Radar with a Decision Component which filters out parasite noises and keep potential targets.

Once done the linked Missile Launcher if all conditions are right, fire a homing missile.

#### Potential Upgrades

* The current radar visualiser doesn't register enemy "bips", I rather focus on stable and structured code but definitly something on my mind.

* Add a more realistic missile Behavior 
  * Now using the predicted target location with predicted missile location 
  * Intent to use a radar attach to the missile  

* More FX and SFX
